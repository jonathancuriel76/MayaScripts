JC_uvMARS

Version 1.5
Fixed a minor issue where Maya's UV Texture Editor Window would remain open when opening the uvMARS window.
Updated the text fiels for a slightly better look.

Installation:
Place JC_uvMARS into your scripts folder.
Place all icons into your icons folder.

I've included the icon 'JC_uvMARS.bmp' for you to add to your shelf.

Using the command 'JC_uvMARS()' will open a modified UV Texture Editor Window
with added functionality.


The 'Snap Align UV Shells' button will only allow you to select two UVs.
The first is from the UV shell you want to move and the second, the UV shell you wish to snap to.

Let me know of any bugs and I'll try to fix them or modify the script as you see fit for your needs.

Enjoy!
